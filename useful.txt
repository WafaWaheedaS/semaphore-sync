P() To acquire the semaphore (call this method - sem_wait)
V() To release the semaphore (call this method -  sem_post)

Types of Semaphore: 
Binary
Counting


Semaphores also have an integer associated to them, which is the number of concurrent threads allowed to pass P() without blocking. Other calls to P() will block until V() is called to free up spots.


Queues:
 Semaphores do not make any guarantee of order. They don't have to actually use a queue or other FIFO structure. When only one thread is allowed at a time, when it calls V(), another (possibly random) thread will then return from its P() call and continue.
